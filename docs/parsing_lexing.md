Lexing, also known as lexical analysis or tokenization, is the process of breaking a sequence of characters into meaningful units called tokens. In the context of programming languages and shells, lexing is the first step in the compilation or interpretation process.

The lexer takes a stream of characters as input (such as a user's input string) and converts it into a sequence of tokens, which are the smallest identifiable units in the language. These tokens represent different parts of the input, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, and symbols.

Here's a simplified overview of the lexing process:

1. Input Stream: The lexer takes a stream of characters as input, which can be a user's input string or a file containing code.

2. Scanning: The lexer scans the input stream character by character, processing each character and grouping them into tokens.

3. Tokenization: Based on predefined rules or patterns, the lexer recognizes and categorizes the characters into different token types. For example, if the lexer encounters a sequence of characters that matches a predefined keyword like "if" or "while," it generates a keyword token.

4. Token Generation: As the lexer identifies tokens, it generates token objects containing information about the token type and possibly additional metadata. Each token may have a value associated with it, representing the actual content of the token. For instance, if the token is an identifier, the associated value would be the name of the identifier.

5. Token Stream: The lexer outputs a stream of tokens, representing the meaningful components of the input. This token stream is then used by the parser or other components of the language processing pipeline for further analysis.

By separating the input into tokens, lexing simplifies the subsequent stages of parsing and analysis, as the parser no longer needs to deal with individual characters but can operate on higher-level abstractions represented by tokens.

Lexing is a fundamental step in building compilers, interpreters, and language processing tools, as it enables the recognition and extraction of meaningful elements from the source code or user input.
